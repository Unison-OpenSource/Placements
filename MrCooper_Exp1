# Mr. Cooper Interview Process Experience

## 1. Online Coding Round
- **Questions:** 2 Medium Level questions & 1 Hard question (Trees or Graphs)
- **MCQs on:** SQL, Data Structures, OOPS, Computer Networks, Aptitude.
- **Experience:** Solved almost two questions (not all test cases passed) but got selected for the next round.

## 2. Long Coding Round (System Design & Implementation)
- **Task:** Inventory Management System (common for all candidates)
- **Process:**
  1. Segregated into batches.
  2. Draw a **Class Diagram or UML Diagram** defining the given use case.
  3. May ask for **System Architecture Diagram** (30-45 mins).
  4. Review of diagrams by interviewers.
  5. Implement the system using **OOPS concepts in Java**.
  6. Not necessary to fully run the code, but explain the approach.
  7. Interaction with assigned mentors who select 3 candidates from each batch.

## 3. Technical Round 1
- **Topics Covered:** Data Structures, OOPS, SQL, Full Stack Development (FSD)
- **Questions:**
### OOPS Interview Questions:
1. Explain all OOPS concepts (Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Abstraction)
2. Why is OOPS needed?
3. How to implement Encapsulation?
4. Types of Polymorphism with examples.
5. Abstract classes and keywords to implement them.
6. Inheritance and its implementation.

### Data Structures:
1. Use of DS & Types of DS
2. Concepts of Non-Linear DS
3. Linked List - Pseudo code logic to perform operations.
4. Stack - Code to perform stack operations.

### Database Management (DBMS):
1. **Schema Design:** Normalize table from class diagram in Round 2.
2. **Joins:** Types of joins & query-based join tasks.
3. SQL Query to find unique names in a student table.
4. Classification of SQL (DDL, DML...)

### Programming-Based Questions:
1. Print all array elements without keywords.
2. Difference between `while`, `do-while`, and `for` loop.
3. Reverse array **without loops** in **O(N)** complexity.
4. Array vs Linked List - Which is better?
5. Dynamic Memory Allocation - Handling concepts.

### Full Stack Development (FSD):
1. **What is FSD?**
2. **Stages in FSD.**
3. **Technologies used in frontend & backend.**
4. **Connecting to a database.**
5. **React-based Questions:**
   - `useEffect()`, `useState()`, `useLocation()`.
   - How to pass parameters while redirecting?

> **Duration:** ~1.5 hours

## 4. Technical Round 2
- **Focus:** Data Structures, Algorithms, Java Collections, Computer Networks.
- **Questions:**
  1. Reverse a Linked List.
  2. Tree Traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder).
  3. Infix to Postfix Conversion.
  4. Validate Balanced Parentheses `{[]()}` → `true`, `{[](){ }{(` → `false` (Stack-based approach).
  5. Linked List traversal techniques.
  6. Finding middle element in LL (Rabbit-Tortoise Algorithm).
  7. Java Collections.
  8. Coding project tasks using **Java ArrayList** (alternatively structures).
  9. DFS, BFS Pseudo Code.
  10. Checking Palindrome using a Linked List.
  11. **Computer Networks:**
      - How does a search engine work when a website loads?
      - TCP/IP layers, OSI Model.

> **Duration:** ~40 minutes

After this round, I got rejected. The final round follows.

## 5. HR Round
1. Discussion about projects & involvement.
2. Learnings from internship.
3. Discussion about resume details (qualities, skills mentioned).
4. CGPA question (To test confidence, not overconfidence - Answer should be reasonable).
5. Expectations about the company, preferred work location.
6. **Final Question:** "Do you have any queries?"

---

### **Key Takeaways for Preparation:**
✅ **Focus on:** Data Structures, Algorithms, OOPS, SQL, Full-Stack Development.
✅ **Practice writing code on paper** (for technical rounds).
✅ **Be clear with fundamentals** (Java, React, SQL, DS concepts).
✅ **Be honest in your resume** (Questions will be asked based on your mentioned skills).
✅ **Good Communication is important** (Explain solutions clearly to the interviewers).
